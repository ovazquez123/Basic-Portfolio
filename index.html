	<p style="float:center"> Hello All! My name is Omar Esai Vazquez, I am a UCSD graduate with a degree in Sociology and currently work for the department of Bioengineering. I was born and raised here in San Diego. My favorite activities include: Long walks through Balboa Park and walks through Seaport Village, as well as all other areas in San Diego. I'm a foodie and love to eat all types of Pizza. I'm a huge baseball fan and I love watching my Padres play especially at Petco Park. My current endeavors are to learn to code. I'd love to become a fullstack engineer. I am currently a UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp Student. Interestingly enough HTML, CSS and JavaScript are my current areas of focus. </p>
